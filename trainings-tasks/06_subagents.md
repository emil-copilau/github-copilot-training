## 🎯 Module VI: Subagents — Coordinating Specialized Agents in the IDE

### 📚 Goal: Learn how to use prepared GitHub Copilot agents and Subagents to offload context, delegate focused work, and combine specialized results inside a single IDE workflow.

In the previous module, you worked with Custom Agents and autonomous Coding Agent workflows. In this module, you will reuse prepared local agents inside VS Code and learn how Subagents isolate repository research, implementation, and review inside the same Copilot Chat request.

Subagents allow Copilot to delegate focused work into isolated contexts and return only the useful result back to the main chat thread. This helps reduce context overload, improves visibility into multi-step workflows, and makes complex requests easier to structure and inspect.

---

### ⚠️ Version Requirement

This exercise requires:

- **VS Code 1.109 or newer**
- Current GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions
- **`chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled`** enabled
- **`runSubagent`** enabled in Copilot Chat tools

---

## 🧠 Why Subagents Matter

Subagents are useful when one chat session would otherwise become noisy or overloaded.

They let Copilot offload focused work into isolated contexts, bring back only the relevant result, and keep the main thread easier to understand.

Typical examples:

- **Research** → inspect the codebase and identify patterns
- **Implementation** → make focused edits
- **Review** → validate correctness, maintainability, type hints, and tests

### ⭐ Key Takeaway

Subagents let Copilot break one complex request into specialized internal runs while preserving one coherent top-level workflow.

This is especially valuable in Copilot because it lets you:

- offload context instead of pushing every detail into the main chat thread
- use specialized worker agents for different responsibilities
- experiment with different worker models
- inspect what each worker contributed back to the final answer

## Exercises: Observing and Using Subagents

| Step | Feature | Instructions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6.1** | **Enable Subagents** | Open **Copilot Chat**, switch the mode picker to **Agent**, open the **Tools** menu, and enable **`runSubagent`**. Also verify the setting **`Chat > Agent in Subagent`** is enabled. |
| **6.2** | **Review Prepared Agents** | Review the prepared agents in `.github/agents`: `FeatureBuilder`, `RepoResearcher`, `Implementer`, and `Reviewer`. Focus on each agent’s role, tools, and model configuration. |
| **6.3** | **Use the Coordinator** | In Copilot Chat, keep the mode picker on **Agent** and select **Feature Builder** from the custom agent picker. |
| **6.4** | **Run a Structured Task** | **Chat:** `Build a new endpoint to change task status. Use Repo Researcher as a subagent to locate the FastAPI structure and current status handling. Then use Implementer as a subagent to add the endpoint. Then use Reviewer as a subagent to review correctness, typing, and tests. Finish with a concise summary, risks, and follow-up.` |
| **6.5** | **Inspect the Execution** | Expand the collapsed tool calls and identify which subagent ran for each step. Note what each one contributed back to the coordinator. |
| **6.6** | **Make One Meaningful Extension** | Extend the completed workflow with one forward-only improvement. Example ideas: add stronger validation, improve the test, refine the response model, or improve the review criteria. |
| **6.7** | **Explore Freely** | Now go beyond the guided task. Change one worker agent, change one model, add a new specialized subagent, or try a new feature request of your own. The goal is to observe how orchestration changes result quality, visibility, and workflow feel. |

## 🧠 Lesson Learned: Offloading Context Improves AI Collaboration

Subagents introduce a practical engineering pattern for AI-assisted development:

- **Offload context** so the main thread stays concise
- **Specialize workers** for research, implementation, and review
- **Coordinate results** in one final response
- **Experiment deliberately** with agent roles, models, and output formats

This is the next step after Agentic Workflow: not only delegating work, but structuring that delegation so it is easier to inspect, compare, and improve.

---

## 💡 Go Further

After completing the guided workflow, use the prepared agents as a starting point and explore your own orchestration style.

Try changing:

- one worker agent
- one model
- one prompt structure
- one output format
- or one feature request

The goal is not to memorize one workflow, but to learn how to shape and inspect multi-agent collaboration inside Copilot.
